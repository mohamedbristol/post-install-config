</p>
<p>
Here in the first step, I created a supreme admin role inside of osTicket to give the member or members of the role, access to everything and allow them to do or assign anything. Complete access!

In this step, I simply just created a system administrators department for a certain type of people who can fix these problems.

</p>
<p>
Here as demostrated, I configured a new agent John Doe. John Doe has limited access only being able to view tickets and also being apart of the support team as seen in the picture above. Prior to creating John Doe, I also configured another agent named Jane Doe. She which has supreme access and aslo being apart of the sys-admin department.

<p>
In this last step I will be displaying is setting SLA's. In this particular SLA, i set it to severity A with a 1 hour grace period, shceduled to be done within the days time.
